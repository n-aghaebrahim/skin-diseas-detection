# Skin Disease Object Detection using YOLOv8

This repository contains the code for a skin disease object detection model using YOLOv8. The model is trained on a dataset of skin images and can detect various types of skin diseases.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train and test the model can be found in the `data` directory. The dataset consists of two subdirectories: `train` and `test`. The `train` directory contains the training images and annotations, while the `test` directory contains the testing images and annotations.

## Model

The YOLOv8 model used in this project can be found in the `models` directory. The `yolov8.cfg` file contains the model architecture, while the `yolov8.weights` file contains the pre-trained weights for the model. The `yolov8.py` file contains the Python script for loading and using the model.

## Scripts

The `scripts` directory contains the Python scripts for training and testing the skin disease object detection model. The `train.py` script can be used to train the model on the training dataset, while the `test.py` script can be used to evaluate the model on the testing dataset.

## Utils

The `utils` directory contains utility scripts for data preprocessing, visualization, and other tasks. The `data.py` script contains functions for loading and preprocessing the skin disease dataset, while the `visualization.py` script contains functions for visualizing the model's predictions.
